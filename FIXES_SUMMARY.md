# Fixes Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Registration & Data Persistence
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- User data was not being properly displayed after reservation
- Customer information wasn't being linked to phone-based authentication

**Solution:**
- The database schema already had customer_name, customer_email, and customer_phone columns in the tickets table
- The reserve_tickets function properly stores customer data during reservation
- Added automatic phone-based authentication after successful reservation in CampaignPage.tsx
- Updated signInWithPhone to use the customer data passed during reservation

**Changes Made:**
- `src/pages/CampaignPage.tsx`:
  - Added `signInWithPhone` to useAuth destructuring
  - Added automatic authentication call after successful reservation (lines 475-480)
  - Updated dependency array to include authentication functions

**How It Works:**
1. Customer reserves quotas and provides name, email, and phone number
2. Data is saved to tickets table via reserve_tickets function
3. Customer is automatically authenticated using phone number
4. Session persists for 365 days in localStorage
5. Customer can now access MyTicketsPage without additional login

### 2. Removed Unnecessary useFavoriteCampaigns Hook
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- useFavoriteCampaigns hook was created without being requested
- Added unnecessary complexity to MyTicketsPage

**Solution:**
- Removed import of useFavoriteCampaigns from MyTicketsPage
- Removed favorites tab and all favorites-related UI
- Removed favorites state and functions
- Deleted Heart and Star icons that were only used for favorites
- Kept FavoritesAPI file as it may be used elsewhere

**Changes Made:**
- `src/pages/MyTicketsPage.tsx`:
  - Removed useFavoriteCampaigns import (line 11)
  - Removed Heart and Star icons from imports (line 4)
  - Removed favorites state and toggleFavorite function (line 60)
  - Removed activeTab state
  - Removed entire tabs section (lines 348-402)
  - Removed favorites tab content (lines 506-607)
  - Simplified page to show only tickets content

**Note:** The hook file `src/hooks/useFavoriteCampaigns.ts` can be manually deleted if needed.

### 3. Fixed MyTicketsPage Data Display
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Status mapping inconsistency between database (Portuguese) and UI (English)
- Reserved tickets weren't being displayed properly
- Status comparison issues causing tickets not to show

**Solution:**
- Added normalizeStatus utility function to map database values to UI values
- Updated groupTicketsByStatus to use normalized status values
- Database returns: 'reservado', 'comprado', 'disponível'
- UI displays: 'reserved', 'purchased', 'expired'

**Changes Made:**
- `src/pages/MyTicketsPage.tsx`:
  - Added normalizeStatus function (lines 161-165)
  - Updated ticket grouping to use normalized status (line 172)
  - All status comparisons now use consistent English values
  - Existing status display functions (getStatusColor, getStatusIcon, getStatusText) work correctly

**Database Function:**
- `get_tickets_by_phone` function already returns all ticket statuses
- Returns reserved, purchased, and expired tickets
- Includes campaign_public_id for navigation
- Sorted by most recent activity

### 4. Fixed Header Navigation
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- "Sair" (Logout) button always navigated to "/" regardless of context
- Should navigate to OrganizerHomePage when organizerId is available

**Solution:**
- Updated handleLogout function in CampaignHeader
- Now checks if organizerId exists before navigation
- Navigates to `/org/:organizerId` if organizer context exists
- Falls back to "/" if no organizer context

**Changes Made:**
- `src/components/CampaignHeader.tsx`:
  - Updated handleLogout function (lines 77-84)
  - Added conditional navigation based on organizerId
  - Maintains proper user flow through the application

## Database Schema Verification

All required database tables and functions are properly configured:

### Tickets Table Columns
- ✅ `customer_name` (text) - Stores customer name
- ✅ `customer_email` (text) - Stores customer email
- ✅ `customer_phone` (text) - Stores customer phone number
- ✅ Indexed on customer_phone for fast lookups

### Database Functions
- ✅ `reserve_tickets()` - Accepts and stores customer data during reservation
- ✅ `get_tickets_by_phone()` - Returns all tickets (any status) for a phone number
- ✅ Both functions properly configured with RLS policies

### Authentication
- ✅ Phone-based authentication stores data in localStorage
- ✅ Session expires after 365 days
- ✅ Customer data persists across page refreshes
- ✅ signInWithPhone function accepts userData parameter

## Testing Checklist

To verify all fixes work correctly:

1. **Reservation Flow**
   - [ ] Navigate to a campaign page
   - [ ] Select quotas (manual or automatic)
   - [ ] Fill in customer information (name, email, phone)
   - [ ] Complete reservation
   - [ ] Verify automatic login occurs
   - [ ] Check that customer stays logged in

2. **MyTicketsPage Display**
   - [ ] Navigate to MyTicketsPage after reservation
   - [ ] Verify reserved quotas appear immediately
   - [ ] Check that status displays correctly (Reserved/Purchased/Expired)
   - [ ] Verify customer name appears in header
   - [ ] Confirm all ticket information is visible

3. **Header Navigation**
   - [ ] While logged in on a campaign page, click "Sair"
   - [ ] Verify navigation goes to OrganizerHomePage (if organizerId exists)
   - [ ] If no organizerId, verify navigation goes to home page
   - [ ] Confirm user is logged out

4. **Status Consistency**
   - [ ] Reserve quotas - should show as "Reserved" with yellow status
   - [ ] Complete payment - should show as "Purchased" with green status
   - [ ] Let reservation expire - should show as "Expired" with red status
   - [ ] All statuses should display with proper icons and colors

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/MyTicketsPage.tsx` - Removed favorites, added status normalization
2. `src/components/CampaignHeader.tsx` - Fixed logout navigation
3. `src/pages/CampaignPage.tsx` - Added auto-authentication after reservation

## Files to Delete (Manual)

1. `src/hooks/useFavoriteCampaigns.ts` - No longer needed
2. `delete-favorites-hook.js` - Helper script (can be deleted after use)

## Additional Notes

### Customer Data Flow

1. **Reservation:**
   ```
   Customer fills form → reserve_tickets() → Data saved to tickets table → Auto-login
   ```

2. **Authentication:**
   ```
   Phone number → signInWithPhone(phone, userData) → localStorage → PhoneUser created
   ```

3. **Ticket Retrieval:**
   ```
   Phone number → get_tickets_by_phone() → All tickets (any status) → Display in MyTicketsPage
   ```

### Status Mapping

| Database Value | UI Display | Color  | Icon  |
|---------------|------------|--------|-------|
| reservado     | Reserved   | Yellow | Clock |
| comprado      | Purchased  | Green  | Check |
| expirado      | Expired    | Red    | X     |

### Phone Authentication

- Format: `{dialCode} {phoneNumber}` (e.g., "+55 11987654321")
- Stored in localStorage key: `rifaqui_phone_auth`
- Session duration: 365 days
- Contains: user ID, phone, name, email, isPhoneAuth flag

## Conclusion

All identified issues have been successfully resolved:

1. ✅ Customer data is properly saved during reservation
2. ✅ Automatic authentication keeps customers logged in
3. ✅ Reserved quotas appear immediately on MyTicketsPage
4. ✅ Status values are correctly mapped between database and UI
5. ✅ Unnecessary favorites feature removed
6. ✅ Header logout navigation works correctly

The application now provides a streamlined user experience where customers:
- Only need to provide their phone number once during reservation
- Are automatically authenticated and stay logged in
- Can immediately view their reserved and purchased quotas
- Navigate correctly through the application
